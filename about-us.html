  <div class="about">
    <p1>
      We are a FIRST Robotics team from Calumet Michigan. We compete at local and state events every year, making a new
      robot and forming alliances with other teams from all over the state. We have a dedicated team of students and
      alumni who build (and help) make our robot each year to compete with other FRC teams.
      For an FRC competition, we build a robot to perform specific tasks and race against other teams to earn points for
      successfully completing challenges. As part of our team, we gain hands-on experience with CAD, 3D printing, rapid
      prototyping, Programming, and CNC machining. We also acquire teamwork skills such as organization, creativity,
      work
      ethic, communication, and collaboration. We spend a considerable amount of time working on our robot during build
      season, and by the end of the year, we form a tight-knit team.
      (Team photo, preferably a competition or a recent one with as many people as possible)
      This year’s competition is Crescendo, a music-themed game, where we had to learn how to pick up orange foam rings
      called ‘Notes’, and deliver them into goals. The Notes have dedicated targets on the playing field, each with
      different music-themed names.
      (insert picture of someone with notes stacked on their shoulders… or of Lorelei making the rock face with the
      earrings)
      As a part of our Community, we take part in many local and school-wide events. If you would like to know more,
